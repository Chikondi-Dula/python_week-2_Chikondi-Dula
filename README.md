2. Appends the elements `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to `my_list`.
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position in the list.
4. Extends `my_list` with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element from `my_list`.
6. Sorts `my_list` in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30`.
